      <h2>About Ty</h2>
      <p>
        Meet Ty! He's 19, and the middle sibling in the family. He's the most mechanically determined in the family by
        a long shot. He's had his '96 Miata for forever, and he has made it his. He likes drifting, automotive stuff, 
        and welding. He's one of the most diligent and smart people I know. Enjoy this clip of him tearing it up in 
        the miata!
